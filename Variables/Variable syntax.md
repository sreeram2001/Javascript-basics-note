**Variable Naming Rules :

Cannot be a Reserved keyword like if,else
Should be meaningful
Cannot Begin with a number e.g 25variable
Cannot have a space or hyphen(-)
They are case-sensitive in Javascript

Best Notation for variable names is using Camel Notation (e.g) let firstLast = 'tree';

Declaring Multipe Variables => let ab = 'hi', bb = 'hello';
