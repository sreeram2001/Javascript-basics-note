**<script> Tag**: 
  
To write Javascript code in HTML file, We need to use the the <script> </script> tags.
  
script tag can be placed in head section or in the body section.
  
**Why place it in Body Section** :
  
Browser parses the file from top to bottom, if you put in head, browser may get busy in parsing the javascript code and will not render the contents of the browser page quickly.
Making it uncomformtable for the user.


**console.log();** :
  
=> console.log('Hello There');
  
This is a statement or a piece of code that expresses an action to be taken place. 
We log a message in the console. Use only single quotes for Strings.

  

**// Comment** :
  
// is used to add comments to our code.
  
Comments are nothing but description to your code, It is not executed by js engine.
  
(e.g.) console.log('Hello');   //Hello will be printed in the console

  

**Seperate JS File** :
  
Html is all about the content, Whereas javascript is all about how your web-page behaves, .js is the file extension of a Javascript File.
  
Reference for a Javascript File in a HTMl file : 
  
<script src="filename"></script>
  
(e.g) => <script src = "index.js"></script>
