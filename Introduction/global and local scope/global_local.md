**Scope :**

**Global Scope :**

Globally declared variables are accesible everywhere, we can have access to the const or variable to all the functions and everywhere throughout the code.
Local variables or constants in a function have precedence over global variables or constants.

The above image is an example of Global Scope, where the vraible c is a global variable and can be accessed inside the function named Mate.

**Local Scope :**

In the image or example given above, the constant s is a local variable and is hence a local scope, it is not accesible outside the function and displays
a reference error when accesed in any other place outside that function.
